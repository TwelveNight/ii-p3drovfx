/**
 * Alt+Tab's peek: hold still on one window and the screen shows a live picture of it, drawn
 * exactly where the window is - on its own monitor, at its own size, even when it lives on
 * another workspace - over that workspace's wallpaper. Nothing moves in the compositor while
 * peeking, so Escape leaves everything where it was; a release switches with animations off
 * (WindowSwitcher) underneath the peek, which holds until the window has focus and then fades
 * away over the real window in the same place.
 *
 * With `peekWholeWorkspace` the rest of the workspace comes too: its other windows, stacked
 * as Hyprland stacks them (a special workspace over the dimmed workspace it covers), and the
 * bar left showing - the peek then covers only the part of the screen windows can use.
 *
 * The picture is captured ahead: once the switcher is up and the selection holds still for a
 * moment, the (invisible) peek already streams it, so the peek opens on a picture instead of
 * an empty backdrop - a window on another workspace takes a good half second to send its first
 * frame. The backdrop waits for the picture either way.
 *
 * Every window gets a capture of its own. Pointing one capture at another window kept the old
 * window's frames in its buffers, and the screen flickered between the two every frame.
 *
 * The window is drawn the way Hyprland draws it (`windowLooks`): at its own opacity (rules,
 * override and decoration.*_opacity), inside its border, with Hyprland's corners - a
 * superellipse when rounding_power is above 2 - over the wallpaper as the shell draws it
 * behind windows, across the whole screen. A dim over the current screen let the window you
 * were leaving show through a translucent one, and around it.
 *
 * Its own click-through layer, ordered under the island and the panel (rules.lua), so the
 * switcher stays readable above it. Loaded by every family next to the panel.
